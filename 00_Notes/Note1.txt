1. Var:- Not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope.
2. let accountState; :- It gives undefined by default.
3. "use strict";  :- treat all the code of js as newer version
4. type of undefined = undefined
5. type of null = object

6. //conversion of __ into number (type always number but value changes)
  
  if null =>  value is 0
  if string like "33abc", "dhruv" => value is NaN
  if undefined => value is NaN
  if true => 1 and false => 0

7. // conversion of __ into bool  (type remains boolean but value changes)

   if 1 => value is true (similarly of false => 0)
   if "" => value is false
   if "dhruv" => value is true

8. The equality check == and comparison > < >= <= work different,  
   hence comaprision convert null to number , treating it as 0
   that why null>=0 is true and null == 0 is false

9. === strict equality , also check the dataType "2"===2 (false)

10. 2 types of dataTypeS :- 
     
    1. Primitive(send copy of variable) => 7 types :- String,boolean,number,symbol,null,undefined,bigInt

    2. Non-Primitive(Reference) => Array, functions, objects
                
11. Memory 2 types:- (Fig1_Memory)
  
    1.Stack(Primitive)
    2.Heap(Non-Primitive)   
  
12. Use new method called The string interpolation. `${}`
    It is a great feature. It helps in inserting values into string literals. It makes code more readable and avoids clumsiness.

13. //2nd way to initialize the string 
         
         const gameName= new String("dhruv");
         gameName

    It gives object.

14.console.log(balance.toFixed(2)); //precision value

15. Generate random value between a range => 
     
    const min =10
    const max = 20

    console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*(max-min+1))+min);
